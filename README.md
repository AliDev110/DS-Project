# Huffman Code Text File Compressor

### Overview:
This program implements a text file compressor using Huffman coding. It reads a text file, generates Huffman codes, and calculates the average bit rate (ABR) and compression ratio. The program also provides an option to generate an optimal Huffman code.
### Features:
* Reads a text file and generates Huffman codes
* Calculates average bit rate (ABR) and compression ratio
* Option to generate optimal Huffman code
* User-friendly interface
### Usage:
* Run the program
* Enter the file name to compress
* Select option 1 for basic Huffman code or option 2 for optimal Huffman code
* View the generated Huffman codes, ABR, and compression ratio
#### Note:
* The program assumes that the input file is a text file.
* The program uses a binary tree to generate Huffman codes.
* The optimal Huffman code is generated using a min-heap.
